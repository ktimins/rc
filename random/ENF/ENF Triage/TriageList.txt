      Transaction in doubt happened during a delete of a vehicle on the policy. From the app server logs, it looks like during the action, the connection to the SQL server timed out (during the delete) which caused PD to throw the Transaction in doubt because it was unable to delete the vehicle.

      The issue is caused in ODEN when trying to cancel the policy. This is because on the Mailing info table, there is a row with PR in the StateCd column. Oden does not handle PR as a state and bombs on when processing.

      Invalid char cast
      InBldgBPPRat - adNumeric(12, 6) [1673352]
      This is an issue where the user enters a large (7+ digits) limit for BLDG coverage and a very 
         small (like $1) limit for BPP. The field is a ratio BLDG/BPP. The size is 6 digits left and 
         6 digits right of decimal, so cast fails. Previous CSR, 2527998, shows that the client users
         have been notified not to do this as it is invalid. 
      This needs to be discussed with manager/BA to determine if a CSR should be created to fix this 
         in the UI (complex edit) or if we should just let it go as a user error.

      Four occurrences, but all are from the same policy from the same user. Happening somewhere in the IS/IbLocCovgInputEdits/IbLocCovgPROPEdits.InitVars. Lots of stuff in there that could be null.
      Policy looks to have been "External Imported" by either Portal or XMLManager. IB doesn't have an IbLocation (but does have a CoLocation) and is trying to add an IbLocCovgInput.
      Policy is also the same policy that cause the previous ENF in the list ([UT,UT]key is empty Parameter name: keyVal).
      Created CSR#2794653 for this issue.

      Retried messages (for all available occurrences) through ServiceTest, could not reproduce error.
      As we have only had one policy come through after the 16.04 push, I am going to put notes on the ENF and set it to resolved. If it reopens, we will look at it again. In the past, we could not figure out the issue and had to chalk it up to a null policy as the only object that could be null in that function is m_oCoLocVendorValInfo which is essentially "me". Since we are coming through the edits, we don't have a guarantee we have "me", but its a likely assumption.

 Extras:

   I'm not including in this list the F2/F3 S**tstorm currently happening at Allstate right now that is uglying up our nice an pretty list we had.
      I'll be adding CSRs/Adding notes either tonight or tomorrow depending on when this gets solved. I just need the ability to view all the ENFs being generated by this and while filtering out everything else.

   Ask Fawwad about difference between Full Pay and Easy Pay.
      We were all on the email I sent, but here is Fawwad's reply for, at least, documentation sake in this list.
         [QUOTE]
         They are different payment discounts. 
         
         Easy Pay is an enrollment method. Enrollment means setting up automatic recurring payments on the policy, using a checking account or credit card. Easy Pay is when recurring payments are set up using checking account, and Recurring Credit Card is, well, you already figured it out. 
         Allstate offers a discount if a policy is signed up on Easy Pay. 
         
         Full Pay is a discount that is offered if payment is made in full, regardless of the method of payment. 
         
         A policy can have both discounts if the Insured chooses.

      Per Fawwad: "Yes, this is a valid message. If the Payment Plan is manually changed to Full Pay in Policy Decisions prior to full payment being received by Billing, the system prevents double-dipping into the Full Pay Discount by not processing the Billing message through. Both of these policies are in that situation. 
         This message can be safely ignored. It is not an error but rather a sort of FYI."
